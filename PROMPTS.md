## Session: TheWordPressTeam Clone Project

### Prompt 1
study this website, you can run it locally, see the Clone.png for visuals and tell me how would you go about Cloning it and make it fully editable via Sanity

### Prompt 2
run this project locally for testing before we build

### Prompt 3
Everything works 200%. Based on the plan you layed out, let's implement that cloning plan now!

### Prompt 4
All references to Designjoy should be changed to TheWordPressTeam

### Prompt 5
You didn't clone the site as it shows on DesignJoy, what was difficult to clone because the code is already there?

### Prompt 6
I didn't say simply the version of DesignJoy I said clone the code it's already there, you don't have to be creative or anything, just clone that code, and I asked you to only change DesignJoy to SiteGuru, that's the only change, the rest needs to be cloned as is word to word, pixel to pixel, everything!

### Prompt 7
you missing the animations, some of the elements are a bit off, and alignment thereof, the two border lines on the left and right of where the page width starts and ends are cutting through the content, whereas the original clone thre's a padding before and after the content.

the background of the page is off white, the hovering of the login and book a call button are not working as the clone.

the two sections of recent work and apps, we bsites, logos and more, have a bacground as well, same thing Join TheWordPressTeam card, the background needs to be sorted

the smilely faces at the bottom of they need to be enlarged by quite a lot, fix these things.

this is all in the clone folder all the code is there to copy

### Prompt 8
our width is 1200 but our content doesn't start there becuase there's a padding, remove that padding and content should but against 1200 containter.

don't change the layout of the original design, things are now all over the place, look closely at the clone folder and make sure that you implement that as is.

don't alter design from the original code, pay attention to the font weight throughout your document.

create a md file and save all the prompts I give you there

### Prompt 9
and make sure that you don't omit the original components as well, I see that there's no longer those 5 cards below the "It's "you'll never go back" better" section, pay attention to such small detials

### Prompt 10
there's that picture (card) in the "Join TheWordPressTeam" card under "One subscription, endless possibilities" section, that picture in the clone have animation but your codebase doesn't.

those 6 cards had a scrolling right and left arrow and they were showing in one row and can scroll to left or right but you are showing all of the mat once, pay attention to those small details. don't create something new, clone exactly waht is in the original codebase I gave youm its there already
